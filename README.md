# StreetSwap
Repository for COS471 project: StreetSwap

StreetSwap is a dApp with the ability to mint “Street” passes in the form of NFTs for social clubs on Prospect Street. These passes can then be traded among users until the event starts, upon which the NFT will be presented and the original minter will burn the NFT as the ticket has been used.
